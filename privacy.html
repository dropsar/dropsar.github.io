    <h1>Privacy Policy for Drops</h1>
    <p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application <strong>Drops</strong> (“Application”) for mobile devices, created by <strong>Wox, Inc</strong>. Drops is designed to help you discover and share music based on your geolocation by creating and interacting with "drops."</p>

    <h2>What Information Does the Application Obtain and How Is It Used?</h2>
    <h3>User-Provided Information</h3>
    <p>The Application only collects identifiable information when you register an account with us. Registration is optional, but some features may require an account to fully function.</p>
    <p>When you register, you provide:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Name</strong>, <strong>email address</strong>, <strong>username</strong>, and <strong>password</strong></li>
        <li>Details of the <strong>drops</strong> you collect or create</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information enables essential app functions and is not used for marketing or promotional outreach.</p>

        <li>General usage data to help us understand how the Application is used</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is primarily used for analytics and service improvement.</p>

    <h2>Does the Application Collect Real-Time Location Information?</h2>
    <p>Drops uses city-level geolocation only to enhance app functionality by showing relevant music drops in your area. <strong>Precise real-time location data is not collected</strong>. Location information tied to drops is shared only with the creator and participants, and remains non-identifiable to protect user privacy.</p>
    <p>If you prefer not to share your city-level location, you may disable location permissions in the Application or in your mobile device settings.</p>

    <h2>Do Third Parties See and/or Have Access to Information Obtained by the Application?</h2>
    <p>Yes, but only as outlined here. We may share limited user information with third parties in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong>: To comply with legal processes, such as subpoenas, or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities.</li>
        <li><strong>Protection of Rights and Safety</strong>: When necessary to protect our rights, your safety, or the safety of others, and to prevent fraud.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: With trusted third-party providers, such as Google Analytics, who assist in analytics services for the app. These providers have no independent rights to your information and adhere to this privacy policy.</li>
        <li><strong>AR Service Providers</strong>: We may also rely on <strong>Niantic 8th Wall</strong> to enable specific augmented reality functions within the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Are My Opt-Out Rights?</h2>

    <h2>Data Retention Policy and Managing Your Information</h2>
    <p>User data provided when creating an account is retained for as long as the account is active. Automatically collected data is retained for up to 24 months, after which it may be stored in aggregate for analytics.</p>
    <p>If you wish to delete your account or specific data, please contact us at privacy@drops.nyc. Some data may be required for the Application to function fully, and deletion of certain data may limit available features.</p>

    <p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit information from children under 13. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected data from a child without consent, we will delete this information promptly upon request at privacy@drops.nyc.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We prioritize the confidentiality of your information and use physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect it. However, no security measures are completely foolproof. We continue to review and enhance our security protocols to protect your data.</p>
